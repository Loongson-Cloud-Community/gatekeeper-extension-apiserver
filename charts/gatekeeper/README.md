[Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) is an open-source project that serves as a policy-based, declarative Kubernetes configuration validation tool. The Gatekeeper project aims to assist teams in ensuring that workloads and configurations within their Kubernetes clusters adhere to predefined security and operational specifications.

Gatekeeper utilizes Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and controllers to enforce policies on Kubernetes resources. It employs rule-based configurations to define constraints on resources such as workloads, service accounts, network policies, and more, ensuring they align with organizational or team-defined best practices and security standards.

Key features of Gatekeeper include:

1. **Policy Definition:** Gatekeeper allows users to define policies using Kubernetes-style YAML files. These policy rules typically include constraints on resources, such as labels, annotations, resource quotas, and more.

2. **Flexibility:** Gatekeeper provides a flexible, extensible framework that allows for the creation of custom policies based on organizational requirements.

3. **Webhook Validation:** Gatekeeper utilizes Kubernetes' dynamic admission control mechanism and integrates with the Kubernetes API Server through webhooks to validate resources. This means that when users attempt to create, update, or delete resources, Gatekeeper will validate these requests and either deny or allow them based on policies.

4. **OPA Integration:** Gatekeeper integrates with the Open Policy Agent (OPA) for policy evaluation. This enables Gatekeeper to leverage OPA's powerful policy engine, supporting more complex and advanced policy definitions.

Through Gatekeeper, teams can enforce security and operational standards at the cluster level, ensuring the stability and security of the Kubernetes environment.
