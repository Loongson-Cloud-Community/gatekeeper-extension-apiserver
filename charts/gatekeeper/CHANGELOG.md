[Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) is an admission controller for Kubernetes that allows flexible configuration of policies, using [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) to validate requests to create and update resources on a Kubernetes cluster.

Gatekeeper enables the flexible definition of admission policies, enforcing security admission reviews at the cluster level to ensure stability and regulatory compliance of Kubernetes clusters.

### Features
